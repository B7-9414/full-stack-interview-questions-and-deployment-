what is the difference between arraylist and linked list ? 
1) ArrayList uses a dynamic to store the elements. ex: if you want add element in between 3,4 will be slow ==> 2,3,4 and is updating the cpacity by it self in search element will be faster 
   LinkedList uses a doubly to store the elements. oject has 2 node next and prives if i want to add new element in between will add object with no removing any element faster in search element will be slower the implementation from queue

arraylist: dynamic
array: fixed 

what is the difference between treemap and hashmap ?
HashMap implemented by Hash Table sorted not garnteed 
TreeMap implemented by Red-Black tree sorted garnteed

what is the difference between HashMap and HashTable ?
HashMap:
    its not thread safe and unsynchroized 
    its fast
    working with single thread
    allow null key

HashTable:
    its thread safe and is synchronized 
    its slow 
    works with multiple thread
    dose not allow null key 

what is the difference between stack and linked list ?
    Stack:
          Last In First Out (LIFO) is class not interface 

    LinkedList: 
          works by storing the data and the addresses of other nodes

implementation: 
  Map ==> HashMap ==> HashTable
  Map ==> LinkedHashMap (LinkedHashMap is HashTable and LinkedList)
  Red-Black tree structure ==> TreeMap 

  Ordering:
   HashMap: Not garnteed Ordering on keys or values 
   LinkedHashMap: will not order (if the user put 1 key will print 1)
   TreeMap: garnteed ordering by the key

 performance:
    1. HashMap
    2. LinkedHashMap
    3. TreeMap

Set and Map:
    set:
        1. can not duplicate elements 
        2. an interface taht extends collection interface
        3. store unique values 
    Map:
        1. An interface that maps unique keys to values
        2. A separate interface
        3. represents a maping between a key and values

what is the difference between queue and stack in java ?

    queue:
         is interface extend from collection works according to the FIFO
    stack: 
        s that Stack is LIFO(Last In First Out) class not interface

          2. reference variable point chiled class object thats called upcasting ==> Heap
          3. reference variable can not point to parent class object ==> Heap
compile time : override and overreading 

Polymorphism called many forms 

what is compile time error : 
    its syntax error ==> you can not be able to run the programming
    missing braces , missing semicolon or 
    print the value of variable without declear

what is Collctions and generics :
1. is interface come with 1.2, generics is to spsecfiy the array like <Integer> in 1.5 come generics ,
     in 1.7 update the generics 
2. if you know ur array fix go  with arraylist if you know ur array dicnamic go with Collctions

ex. collection <Integer> a = new ArrayList<>(); ==> this > 1.7 
ex. collection <Integer> a = new ArrayList<Integer>(); ==> this > 1.5

ex. collection <Integer> a = new ArrayList<>(); ==> this collection keyword you can not spsecfiy the index
ex. List <Integer> a = new ArrayList<>(); ==> this List keyword you can spsecfiy the index

collection interface:
    1. set interface
        - sorted set interface
